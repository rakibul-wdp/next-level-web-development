### Functions

1. Scalar
   Scalar functions operate on a single value and return a single value. They perform an operation on each row's data independently.
2. Aggregate
   Aggregate functions operate on a set of values and return a single value summarizing that set. They perform an operation across multiple rows, often used with the GROUP BY clause.
